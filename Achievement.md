# What's your proudest achievement?
One of my proudest achievements recently was my MSc project, a Django Powered smart news application. We had a team of 5 and I convinced the team to tackle technology news. I then ensured we had the right infrastructure (CI) and build in place to make sure we could execute on a solid foundation over the 3 months. All of the work was done remotely (3 in Dublin [various parts], one in Galway and myself in Athlone). Why am I proud? Put simply we delivered in a very short time-frame, to a very high standard, all whilst holding down our usual commitments. What impact did it have? I learned the value of executing on a good foundation, learned things under pressure, including the business (and legal!) side of the house. The project earned us an A+. I also learned the value of industry experience giving focus, as all of us did it part time, we had to be serious about it. Insights I took? Be realistic with plans, have a broad idea of economic value, there's always cool stuff being done you don't know about, so always be curious!
